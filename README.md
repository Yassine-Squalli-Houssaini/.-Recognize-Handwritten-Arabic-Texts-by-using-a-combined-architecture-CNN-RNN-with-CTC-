## Introduction:

Handwritten Arabic text recognition has gained significant attention in recent years due to its numerous applications in fields such as document analysis, optical character recognition, and natural language processing. Developing accurate and efficient algorithms for recognizing handwritten Arabic texts poses unique challenges due to the complex nature of the Arabic script.

In this project, we propose a combined architecture of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) with Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) to recognize handwritten Arabic texts. The CNN component is responsible for extracting relevant spatial features from the input images, while the RNN component captures the sequential dependencies and context within the text. The CTC loss function enables end-to-end training without the need for explicit alignment between the input and output sequences.

To evaluate the proposed architecture, we employed [the IFN/ENIT-database](http://www.ifnenit.com), a comprehensive dataset specifically designed for training and testing Arabic handwriting recognition software. This dataset consists of over 2,200 binary images of handwritten sample forms from 411 writers. From these forms, approximately 26,000 binary word images have been extracted and stored individually for easy access. Furthermore, a ground truth file accompanies each word image, providing essential information such as the word's baseline position and details about the characters used in the word.


By leveraging this rich dataset and utilizing the combined CNN+RNN architecture with CTC, we aim to achieve high accuracy in recognizing handwritten Arabic texts. This research contributes to the advancement of Arabic handwriting recognition technology, facilitating applications such as automated transcription, document digitization, and language analysis in Arabic-speaking regions.
